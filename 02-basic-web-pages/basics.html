    <h1>Internet is easy</h1> <!-- should typically be same title -->
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six level of headings.</p>

    <h2>List</h2>

    <p>This is how to make an unorder list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unorder list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- NOTE: Strict rules
      Don't
        <ul>
          <p></p>
        </ul>

      Do
        <ul>
          <li><p></p></li>
        </ul>
    -->

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, this list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You sholud be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <!--
      Step-by-step procedures like recipes, instructions, and even tables of contents are good candidates for ordered lists, while <ul> lists are better for representing item inventories, product features, pro/con comparisons, and navigational menus.
