    <h1>Internet is easy</h1> <!-- should typically be same title -->
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six level of headings.</p>

    <h2>List</h2>
    <p>This is how to make an unorder list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unorder list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- NOTE: Strict rules
      Don't
        <ul>
          <p></p>
        </ul>

      Do
        <ul>
          <li><p></p></li>
        </ul>
    -->

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, this list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You sholud be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>NOTE: Unorder and Ordered list</h3>
    <p>Step-by-step procedures like recipes, instructions, and even tables of contents are good candidates for ordered lists, while ul lists are better for representing item inventories, product features, pro/con comparisons, and navigational menus.</p>

    <h2>Inline Element</h2>

    <h3>Emphasis (Italic) Element</h3>
    <p><em>Sometime</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <h3>Strong (Bold) Element</h3>
    <p>Other item you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word of phrase</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout! (strong inside em)</strong></em></p>

    <h2>NOTE: HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>distinction between HTML and CSS. HTML markup should provide semantic information about your content—not presentational information</p>

    <h2>Empty Element</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Internet should be getting easier now.</p>
    <p>Regards,<br/> The Authors</p>

    <!--
      HTML condenses consecutive spaces, tabs, or newlines (together known as “whitespace”) into a single space
    -->

    <!--
      However, be very careful not to abuse the <br/> tag. Each one you use should still convey meaning—you shouldn’t use it to, say, add a bunch of space between paragraphs
    -->

    <hr />
    <p>P.S This page is look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>

    <!--
      The transition from one scene of a story into the next or between the end of a letter and a postscript are good examples of when a horizontal rule may be appropriate
    -->
